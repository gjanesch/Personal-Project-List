This is a list of some of my projects -- large-scale data projects, other analyses, and interesting but not data-related work.

### Main Projects
- **[Spotify Cross-Playlist Prediction App](https://github.com/gjanesch/Spotify-Cross-Playlist-Prediction-App):** An RShiny app, intended to take two playlists, and make recommendations from one based on the content of the other.  The full implementation of the project used Spotify's API, R, Docker, and AWS.

### Other Analyses
- **[Hangman Method Comparison](https://github.com/gjanesch/Hangman-Method-Comparison):** Attempting to code up a few different potential strategies in Hangman, and then tried to test them out using a list of English words.  Written in Python.
- **[Wikipedia Experiments](https://github.com/gjanesch/Wikipedia-Experiments):** Some attempts to examine a dump of the English Wikipedia, particularly the structure of the links between pages.  The original intent was to try to create a network of links within Python's `networkx` library, but my computer was unable to generate the full network on its own.  Written in Python.
- **[Stock](https://github.com/gjanesch/Stock-Correlation-vs-LSTM-Prediction-Error):** An experiment with seeing how well a neural network trained on one dataset -- in this case, an individual stock from the S&P500 -- could make predictions on other stocks, and if/how the prediction accuracy changed based on the correlations between the stocks.  Written in Python.
